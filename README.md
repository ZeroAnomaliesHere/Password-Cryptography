The main idea for this program was for it to be somewhat easy to decode/encode by hand if need be, and to allow the storage of the shorter and unencrypted version of the password on paper. That way any peeping toms would see c11 instead of the actual password that would be Mqiyrni.

I would reccomend using at most 5 letters when generating a password because it gets long very quickly. Especially since if the number the character gets bumped pushes it into the "ASCII Print Deadzone" for repl.it (0-32, 127-160) it instead prints the number in hexadecimal as such: **:[hex]:** just without the bold. If I come up with another - prettier - solution, I'll change it accordingly.
